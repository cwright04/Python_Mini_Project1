#format, regarding all your friendsâ€™ names and phone numbers 
#(see attached friends.txt). Your program should store that information 
#and show the user where their friends live based on the area code of the 
#phone numbers, and the number of states where they live 
#(see attached map_areacodes_states.txt).
